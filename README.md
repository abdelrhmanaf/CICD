# CICD Pipeline for Java Web Application

This repository contains the source code and configuration files for the CICD pipeline of a Java web application. The pipeline is implemented using Jenkins and includes the following jobs:

1. **Build:** This job is responsible for building the source code of the Java web application using Maven.

2. **Test:** This job runs unit tests on the compiled code to check for any errors or failures.

3. **Integration Test:** This job runs integration tests on the Java web application to ensure that all components are working correctly together.

4. **Code Analysis:** This job runs static code analysis on the Java source code using SonarQube.

5. **SonarScanner Code Analysis:** This job runs the SonarQube scanner to analyze the code and generate a report.

6. **Deploy Artifact to Nexus Server:** This job deploys the compiled artifact to the Nexus artifact repository.

7. **Staging Deployment:** This job deploys the artifact to a staging server for further testing.

8. **Test URL from Tomcat Server:** This job tests the URL of the deployed application on the Tomcat server to ensure that it is working correctly.

9. **Selenium Test Suite:** This job runs a Selenium test suite to test the functionality of the deployed application.

The pipeline is designed to be fully automated and includes integration with Slack for notification of each job. The pipeline is implemented on an EC2 instance and uses SonarQube, Nexus, and Tomcat as additional components.

## Setup

To use this repository, you will need to have the following components installed and configured:

1. Jenkins: You will need to install Jenkins on an EC2 instance and configure it to use the provided configuration files in the repository.

2. SonarQube: You will need to install SonarQube on another EC2 instance and configure it to use the provided configuration files in the repository.

3. Nexus: You will need to install Nexus on another EC2 instance and configure it to use the provided configuration files in the repository.

4. Tomcat: You will need to install Tomcat on another EC2 instance and configure it to use the provided configuration files in the repository.

5. Slack: You will need to create a Slack workspace and configure Jenkins to use it for notification of each job.

Once you have installed and configured these components, you can clone this repository and use the provided configuration files to set up the CICD pipeline for your Java web application.

## Usage

To use the CICD pipeline, you can create a new Jenkins job and configure it to use the provided Jenkinsfile in the repository. The Jenkinsfile defines the pipeline and includes all the necessary steps to build, test, and deploy the Java web application.

You can also modify the pipeline to suit your specific requirements. For example, you can add additional jobs for security testing or performance testing.

## Conclusion

This CICD pipeline provides a robust and automated approach to building, testing, and deploying a Java web application. It includes a range of jobs that cover all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from building and testing to deployment and monitoring. With Slack integration, the pipeline provides real-time notifications of each job, allowing you to stay informed of the status of your Java web application at all times.
